# AI-Art

I am a big fan of Stable Diffusion. I am creating this sample project to test Stable Diffusion using CoreML.</br>
This is the beginning of text-to-image generation and needs a lot of work to make it perfect.</br>
So feel free to contribute to this project as well.</br></br>

## How to Run This Project

1. **Download CoreML Models**:
   - You must download the CoreML version of Stable Diffusion from [Hugging Face CoreML Community](https://huggingface.co/coreml-community).

2. **Prepare the Model Files**:
   - Copy all files from the `split-einsum` directory and place them under the `AI-Art` project's `Resources > MLResources`.
