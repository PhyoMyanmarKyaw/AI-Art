# AI-Art

<i>❤️ I am a big fan of Stable Diffusion ❤️</i></br>
I am creating this sample project to test Stable Diffusion using apple's CoreML: [ML-Stable-Diffusion](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion).</br> This is the beginning of text-to-image generation and needs a lot of work to make it perfect. So feel free to contribute to this project as well.</br></br>

## How to Run This Project

1. **Download CoreML Models**:
   - Since the size is too big (around 2 GB), I didn't include it in the project file. You must download the CoreML version of Stable Diffusion from [Hugging Face CoreML Community](https://huggingface.co/coreml-community). Alternatively, you can use the model from my demo video - anime style:
     [CoreML Model - Meinamix V10](https://huggingface.co/coreml-community/coreml-meinamix_meinaV10/blob/main/split-einsum/meinamix_meinaV10_split-einsum.zip).

2. **Prepare the Model Files**:
   - Copy all files from the `split-einsum` directory and place them under the `AI-Art` project's `Resources > MLResources`.
