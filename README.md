<i>❤️ I am a big fan of Stable Diffusion ❤️</i></br>
I am creating this sample project to test Stable Diffusion using apple's CoreML: [ML-Stable-Diffusion](https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion).</br> This is the beginning of text-to-image generation and needs a lot of work to make it perfect. So feel free to contribute to this project as well.</br></br>

## How to Run This Project

1. **Download CoreML Models**:
   - Since the size is too big (over 3GB), I didn't include it in the project file. You must download the CoreML version of Stable Diffusion from [Hugging Face CoreML Community](https://huggingface.co/coreml-community). These are ready-made (already converted) CoreML versions. Alternatively, you can convert your own model.
   - (I haven't tested with the XL version; currently, I am using SD 1.5 version.)

2. **Prepare the Model Files**:
   - Copy all files from the `split-einsum` directory and place them under the `AI-Art` project's `Resources > MLResources`.
